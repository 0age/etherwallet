              When you open a bank account, the bank creates an account for you.
            </li>
            <li>
              The bank keeps track of your personal information, account passwords, balances, transactions and ultimately your money.
            </li>
            <li>
              They charge a fee to manage your account and enable services like reversing transactions when your card gets stolen.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can go online and look at your balance, write a check or use your debit card to send money, reset your password, and get a new debit card if you lose it.
